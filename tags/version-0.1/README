* The Movinator *

ABOUT

The Movinator is a small database application. It stores information about
movies, including critic ratings and the user´s rating. Using these it is able
to make reccomendations, predicting what would be the user´s rating for a yet
unseen movie.

More info can be obtained at http://movinator.berlios.de
